If youâ€™ve ever hit latency limits while building logic-heavy appsâ€”youâ€™re not alone. This model delivers fast, reliable reasoning to environments where seconds and megabytes count.Â \nÂ \nWhat makes it different:\n1) Fast and lightweight\n3.8B parameters, 64K context length, deployable on a single GPUâ€”ideal for edge devices and low-latency environments.\n2) Breakthrough efficiency\nDelivers up to 10Ã— higher throughput and 2â€“3Ã— lower latency than Phi-4-mini, while outperforming larger models on math and logic benchmarks.\n3) New hybrid architecture: SambaY\nCombines Mamba, Sliding Window Attention, and Gated Memory Units (GMUs) to boost long-context and decoding performanceâ€”without sacrificing quality.\nÂ \nTry it and push it on Foundry.
